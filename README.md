Final project for HTML with TOP

This is a simple HTML only website with a few recipies from a game and a show I like.

I included links to the places i got the idea for the recipies and to the mediums i chose to draw inspiration from.

I was able to be deliberate with which links opened in a new tab and which replaced current tabs in making the website flow better in whatever way i saw fit.

I learned a lot with problem solving and getting creative to utilize "<br>" to create space between images and links without the use of CSS

I am a little dissapointed that I didnt have to google any solutions so i didnt learn anything new but it was good practice to hammer in older concepts.
    - as i wrote that i decided id google SOMETHING new, ended up adding a gif and having to google the float attribute bc idk CSS yet.
