    <p>Flaming fire flakes are a common snack in Fire Nation territories. Consisting of flakes covered with special spices and roasted at extremely high temperatures, fire flakes are infamous for being hot, though this may vary depending on the cook. It is believed that the fire flakes in the colonies are not as tasty as those in the Fire Islands. Badly prepared or expired fire flakes can cause bodily reactions that have been likened to breathing fire. Eating too many fire flakes can cause people to pass out due to their intense heat.</p>
<br>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>1 Tbsp. Granulated White Sugar</i></li>
        <li><i>1 Pkg. Taco Seasoning</i></li>
        <li><i>1 tsp. Garlic Salt</i></li>
        <li><i>1/4 - 1/2 tsp. Ground Red Pepper Powder</i></li>
        <li><i>4 Heaping Cups Plain Corn Flakes</i></li>
        <li><i>4 Tbsp. Sesame Oil</i></li>
    </ul>
<br>
    <P>Directions:</P>
    <ol>
        <li><i>Preheat your oven to 275 F. In a small bowl whisk together the 1st 4 ingredients until combined.Spice Note: Depending on how flaming you want your flakes, put either the 1/4 or 1/2 tsp. red pepper, or omit it all together if you're fine with taco seasoning level flames.</i></li>
        <li><i>Pour the corn flakes into a large container with a lid & then pour on the sesame oil. Close the lid & toss well until the flakes are completely coated. Add the mix of dry ingredients, close the lid, & toss again until the seasoning is distributed evenly throughout the flakes.</i></li>
        <li><i>Line a tray with parchment paper & pour the seasoned flakes onto the tray. Spread the flakes out evenly & bake for about 15 minutes. Serve warm.</i></li>
    </ol>
<br>
    <p><b>Serving Suggestion:</b></p>
    <p>Add 1 Tbsp. sesame seeds (black or white, or both) to the seasoning mix for added flavor, texture, & color. You could also mix the finished flakes with crumbled seaweed (especially if you can find kimchi flavored). It adds extra Asian flair & flavor, & the colors look really great together. Also, fire flakes are great as a snack but they're also great crushed & sprinkled on plain white rice!</p>
